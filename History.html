  <img src="images/webpage.jpg" alt="First Web Page" class="center">
  <p>The very first ever web page went live on August 6, 1991. It was made by Tim Berners-Lee. It was dedicated to information on the World Wide Web Project.These were text-only pages,as back then there was no visual elements yet made. There are no screenshots of the original page, but this was the closest copy, taken in 1992.  </p>



<h2>The First photo on the internet</h2>
<img src="images/photo.jpg" alt="First Web Page" class="center">
<p>In 1992 Berners-Lee rolled out an update of his browser that could support photos. His team decided to test it, the photo contains a pop parody group called Les Horribles Cernettes taken backstage by an IT developer.Following this it didn't take long for photos to be essential in the Web Design inudstry.Have you found a website without an image?</p>
